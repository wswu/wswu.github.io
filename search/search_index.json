I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at Hilo. My primary research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, though I have broad interests that span Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I aim to build technologies that benefit the local community. Some areas I have recently been working on: AI for Language Revitalization : low-resource and multilingual machine translation, speech recognition and synthesis, educational tools for \u02bb\u014clelo Hawai\u02bbi (Hawaiian) Computational Linguistics : computational etymology, lexicography, corpus linguistics Computational Astronomy : applied machine learning, neural network models for large-scale multimodal datasets Computational Social Science : understanding societal biases and cultural values in multilingual data and large language models I'm recruiting students for Spring 2025! If you are a current UH student interested in any of the above topics, please send me an email. I also organize NACLO on the Big Island. If you are a high school student interested in competing, please see our site page . Before coming to UH Hilo, I was a postdoc at the University of Michigan working with Rada Mihalcea and Lu Wang at the intersection of NLP and computational social science. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Johns Hopkins University, where I was affiliated with the Center for Language and Speech Processing and worked with David Yarowsky on NLP across thousands of languages. Before that, I earned my undergraduate degrees in computer science (as a Turing Scholar ) and in Latin (salv\u0113!) from UT Austin, where I worked with Katrin Erk on computational semantics.","title":"Home"},{"location":"group/","text":"Group Our research group is located at UH Hilo in College Hall, the oldest building on campus!

Outside of CS, I also have experience teaching piano lessons and Latin. At JHU, I helped organize North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad events. This is an annual national competition for middle school and high school students, with lots of fun and challenging puzzles! We do outreach to local schools and host a competition every year.
