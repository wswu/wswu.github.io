I am a postdoc at the University of Michigan, where I work with Rada Mihalcea and Lu Wang on computational social science. I am currently investigating societal biases in text and models across languages and cultures. I did my PhD at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Language and Speech Processing , where I worked with David Yarowsky on NLP across thousands of languages, with a focus on low-resource languages. Before that, I received my MSE in computer science from JHU in 2017, and I received a BS in computer science as a Turing Scholar and BA in Latin from UT Austin, where I worked with Katrin Erk on computational semantics. My research largely falls under AI for Social Good. Broadly, I seek to develop language technologies that educate and improve our lives. My current work is helping us understand how societal biases manifest in the language we produce and models trained on that language. Most of my past work is on breaking down language barriers and is related to multilinguality, low-resource machine translation, and historical linguistics. See publications for a list of publications. I also enjoy teaching and have taught in a variety of settings. In addition, I am an avid musician .
